## About coding style
- Place public classes and methods at the top of files.
- Prefer higher-order functions like `map`/`filter`/`reduce` over `for`/`while`/
`if`.
- Follow the project’s existing syntax, naming, and structure for consistency.
- Aim for single responsibility; as a guideline, keep functions to 10–15 lines a
nd files to around 100 lines.
- Keep comments minimal; convey behavior through well-named, small functions.
